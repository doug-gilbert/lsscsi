To build:
 $ ./configure
 $ make

To install call:
 $ make install
This will most likely need superuser privilege. The executable is placed
in the /usr/local/bin directory while the man page is placed in the
/usr/local/man/man8 directory. The install directory are controlled by
the PREFIX variable in the Makefile. To install executable in the /usr/bin
directory use './configure --prefix=/usr ' instead.

To uninstall the executable and man page call:
 $ make uninstall

To clean out object and executable files from the working directory call:
 $ make clean

To clean out prior to making a tarball (so ./configure needs to be run
on the target system):
 $ make distclean

Rpms are also available. A lsscsi.spec file is included in the tarball
to facilitate building rpms. One way of doing this on a RedHat system
is to place the tarball in the /usr/src/redhat/SOURCE directory and
the spec file in the /usr/src/redhat/SPEC directory. Then execute
'rpmbuild -ba lsscsi.spec' from the "SPEC" directory. [Specifying the
target may help (e.g. 'rpmbuild --target=i386 -ba lsscsi.spec') . If
successful that will deposit the binary rpm in the /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386
directory and the source rpm in the /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS directory.
Building an rpm on Suse and Mandrake is similar (although they use their
names rather than "redhat" in the above paths).


To build a Linux debian "deb" (binary) package, first untar the tarball,
then change directory to the top level within the lsscsi source. Then:
 # chmod +x debian/rules
 # dpkg-buildpackage -b -rfakeroot
The binary deb packages will be placed in the parent directory (of
the lsscsi source directory) if all goes well.
There is a build_debian.sh script in the tarball's top level directory
that does the above.

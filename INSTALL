To build call make with no arguments:
 $ make

To install call:
 $ make install
This will most likely need superuser privelege. The executable is placed
in the /usr/local/bin directory while the man page is placed in the
/usr/local/man/man8 directory. The install directory are controlled by
the PREFIX variable in the Makefile.

To uninstall the executable and man page call:
 $ make uninstall

To clean out object and executable files from the working directory call:
 $ make clean

A dependency file (named .depend) can be built using:
 $ make dep

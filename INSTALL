To build call make with no arguments:
 $ make

To install call:
 $ make install
This will most likely need superuser privelege. The executable is placed
in the /usr/local/bin directory while the man page is placed in the
/usr/local/man/man8 directory. The install directory are controlled by
the PREFIX variable in the Makefile.

To uninstall the executable and man page call:
 $ make uninstall

To clean out object and executable files from the working directory call:
 $ make clean

A dependency file (named .depend) can be built using:
 $ make dep

Rpms are also available. A lsscsi.spec file is included in the tarball
to facilitate building rpms. One way of doing this on a RedHat system
is to place the tarball in the /usr/src/redhat/SOURCE directory and
the spec file in the /usr/src/redhat/SPEC directory. Then execute
'rpmbuild -ba lsscsi.spec' from the "SPEC" directory. If successful then
will deposit the binary rpm in the /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 directory
and the source rpm in the /usr/src/redhat/SRPMS directory. Building
rpm on Suse and Mandrake is quite similar (although they use their names
rather than "redhat" in the above paths).

.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Uses information in sysfs (linux kernels 2.5.50 and later) to list all 
scsi devices (or hosts) currently attached to the system. Options can
be used to control the amount and form of information provided for
each device.
.TP
--classic | -c
The output is similar to that obtained from 'cat /proc/scsi/scsi'
.TP
--generic | -g
Output the scsi generic device file name. Note that if the sg driver
is a module it needs to be loaded otherwise '-' will appear
.TP
--help | -h
Output the usage message and exit
.TP
--hosts | -H
List the SCSI hosts currently attached to the system. If this option is
not given then SCSI devices are listed
.TP
--long | -l
Output additional information for each SCSI device (host)
.TP
--sysfsroot=<dir>
This command usually find the sysfs root directory by examining the
output of /proc/mounts. This option allows the sysfs root directory
to be given explicitly
.TP
--verbose | -v
outputs directory names where information is found
.TP
--version | -V
outputs version number information and exits
.PP
Information for this command is derived from the the sysfs file system
whose mount point is found by examining the contents of /proc/mounts .
SCSI (pseudo) devices that have been detected by the SCSI mid level
will be listed even if the required upper level drivers (i.e. sd, sr,
st or osst) have not been loaded. If the appropriate upper level
driver has not been loaded then the device file name will appear
as '-' rather than something like '/dev/st0'. Note that some
devices (e.g. scanners and medium changers) do not have a primary upper
level driver and can only be accessed via a scsi generic (sg) device
name.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Uses information in sysfs (linux kernels 2.6.0 and later) to list all 
scsi devices (or hosts) currently attached to the system. Options can
be used to control the amount and form of information provided for
each device.
.TP
--classic | -c
The output is similar to that obtained from 'cat /proc/scsi/scsi'
.TP
--device | -d
After outputting the (probable) scsi device name the the device node
major and minor numbers are shown in brackets (e.g. "/dev/sda[8:0]").
.TP
--generic | -g
Output the scsi generic device file name. Note that if the sg driver
is a module it needs to be loaded otherwise '-' will appear
.TP
--help | -h
Output the usage message and exit
.TP
--hosts | -H
List the SCSI hosts currently attached to the system. If this option is
not given then SCSI devices are listed
.TP
--long | -l
Output additional information for each SCSI device (host)
.TP
--verbose | -v
outputs directory names where information is found. Use twice for
more output.
.TP
--version | -V
outputs version number information and exits
.PP
Information for this command is derived from the the sysfs file system
whose mount point is found by examining the contents of /proc/mounts .
SCSI (pseudo) devices that have been detected by the SCSI mid level
will be listed even if the required upper level drivers (i.e. sd, sr,
st or osst) have not been loaded. If the appropriate upper level
driver has not been loaded then the device file name will appear
as '-' rather than something like '/dev/st0'. Note that some
devices (e.g. scanners and medium changers) do not have a primary upper
level driver and can only be accessed via a scsi generic (sg) device
name.

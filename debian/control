Description: list all SCSI devices (or hosts) currently on system
 Uses information provided by the sysfs pseudo file system in the Linux
 kernel 2.6 series, and later, to list SCSI devices (Logical
 Units (e.g. disks)). It can list transport identifiers (e.g. SAS address
 of a SAS disk), protection information configuration and size for storage
 devices. Alternatively it can be used to list SCSI hosts (e.g. HBAs). By
 default one line of information is output per device (or host).

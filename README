Installation instructions are in the INSTALL file.

For a description of this utility see:
http://www.torque.net/scsi/lsscsi.html

This package now depends on sysfsutils version 1.1.0 . Further, lsscsi wants
to sort some directories which needs dlist_sort_custom() which hopefully
will be added soon in the sysfsutils package.

The "man" page may also be useful.

Installation instructions are in the INSTALL file.

For a description of this utility see:
https://sg.danny.cz/scsi/lsscsi.html

The "man" page (lsscsi.8) in this directory may also be useful.

In Linux kernel versions 2.6.37 and 2.6.38 (and perhaps later)
configuring:
  CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED=y
  CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED_V2=y 

causes blocks device names (e.g. /dev/sda) not to be found.

Revisiting this in lk 5.9.6; configuring:
  CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED_V2=y
alone causes blocks device names (e.g. /dev/sda) not to be found.

The build sequence is now:
  ./autogen.sh ; ./configure ; make ; make install
or
  ./bootstrap ; ./configure ; make ; make install
